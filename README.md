## About project
The 3rd Google-Udacity project called Memory Game Project is all about demonstrating my mastery of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, using
DOM selectors and Event Listeners. 
<br>It's a complete browser-based card matching game. 

## How to play?
The game board consists of sixteen "cards" arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, 
each with different symbols on one side. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down. 
The gameplay rules are very simple: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!

- The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.
- The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
- If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
- If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.
- The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.

## Game Behavior
**Memory Game Logic**
<br>The game randomly shuffles the cards. A user wins once all cards have successfully been matched.
<br><br>**Congratulations Popup**
<br>When a user wins the game, a modal appears to congratulate the player and ask if they want to play again. It shows the user how much time it took to win the game, and what the plane rating was.

## Game features
- [x] **Move Counter** - Game displays the current number of moves a user has made.
- [x] **Rating System** based on your moves - At the beginning of a game, it should display 3 planes. After some number of moves, it will change to a lower and lower rating. 
- [x] **Timer** - When the player starts a game, a displayed timer also starts. Once the player wins the game, the timer stops.
- [x] **Restart Button** - A restart button allows the player to reset the game board, the timer, and the rating.
